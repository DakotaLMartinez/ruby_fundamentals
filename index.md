## Welcome to Ruby Fundamentals

Today, we'll be interacting with ruby and learning how we can accomplish tasks related to data traversal. We'll be drawing on our knowledge of JavaScript frequently and comparing and contrasting how these fundamentals work in Ruby.

Moving from JavaScript, one of the first things to note is that the package manager we'll be using is called `bundler`. Bundler is generally used to install gems from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org), though it can also install gems from other sources (like git repositories for example). So:

| Concept  | JS  | Ruby |
|---|---|---|
| Package Manager | npm  | bundler |
| Package Repository  | [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com)  | [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org)  |
| Package Generator  | `npm init`  | `bundle gem insert_gem_name_here`  |

I've generated the source code for today's discussion using the command `bundle gem ruby_fundamentals`. We'll be talking a bit about the directory structure and how the files interact with one another, but if you want to refer to that on its own, I've recorded a quick video explaining how the `bundle gem` command works:

I also have a longer video on how you can [publish a gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrAOlk6qoiM) for later reference.
