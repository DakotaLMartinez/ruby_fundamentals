# Ruby Fundamentals - JS ==> Ruby

## My Focus as a Lecturer

Over the next few weeks, my goal is to help you all to practice your technical communication skills. One of the most challenging parts of learning to code is learning to adjust the way you speak to an unfamiliar degree of accuracy and precision. Your ability to think programatically will improve as you practice using terminology to accurately describe what you're doing as you code. I want to help you all add good habits and skills to your toolbox so you are more effective–and happier–problem solvers.

## Questions to Carry around with you as you code

- What am I trying to do?
- What's happening instead of that?
- How can I explain what's happening now?
- How can I test my explanation?
- Was my explanation correct/complete?

When you watch professional athletes, you will see many variations of a pre-shot routine. 
- A basketball player before shooting a free-throw
- A runner before the start of a race
- A golfer preparing to tee off
- A batter preparing for the pitcher's windup.

Whatever the example, the purpose is to develop a set of behaviors that prepare the mind for the task at hand. Approaching programming in the same way can make it a much more enjoyable experience. As you work with me over the next couple of weeks, one of my goals is to share ideas that you can integrate into your routine to develop solid mind patterns that set you up for success. 

In programming, I see this as a series of questions that you repetitively ask yourself in different situations that move your mind in the directions it needs to go to solve a given type of problem.
